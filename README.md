## 🎯 Motivation

The goal of this project is to build **intuition-first**, biologically grounded computational models that explain how neural activity emerges from simple rules.

Rather than focusing on performance or accuracy alone, the emphasis is on:
- understanding neural dynamics
- interpreting circuit behavior
- connecting neuroscience concepts to AI systems

This approach aligns closely with research-driven environments and interdisciplinary neuroscience labs.
