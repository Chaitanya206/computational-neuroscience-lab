# Computational Neuroscience Lab — Emotion & Spike Modeling

This repository contains my end-to-end project for understanding 
and simulating neural spike behavior, emotional circuits, and 
building an AI model that predicts emotional states from neuron-like signals.

It includes:
- Single neuron simulations (LIF model)
- Multi-neuron emotional circuits
- Spike train generation
- Feature extraction for ML
- Emotion classification using AI
- Detailed notes for each concept
